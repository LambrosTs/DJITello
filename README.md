# DJITello
Python programming the drone to do things like flight routine and stuff

Prerequisites: The computer must have a wireless network so to be able to connect to the drone. You have to install "djitellopy" and import tello so you can use the commands.

My computer: Wireless network card, Visual Studio Code, Windows 11.

-- The main_flight_routine.py is a file with main commands on how to give orders so the drone execute them.

There are many commands to work on already on the library. For example if you write on VSCode drone.move -> it will open a lot o commands to choose.

--  The stream.py is a code so the drone will give you a visual of what its camera looking at on your pc screen.

Caution: When I try to integrade the stream code into other codes for example the main_flight_routine.py it didn't work and I had to use defs!

More codes with funny stuff are coming up. Now I am working on tracking a face and use hand commands to drone.
